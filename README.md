> **Wraith OS** is my personal, custom-built hacking distro — sleek, lightweight, and built on top of BlackArch. It’s tuned for speed, style, and only the tools I actually use. I’m also cooking up some AI features to make recon, scripting, and reporting effortless.  
>  
> Just a side project I’m building and sharing with the world.
